# Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Implementations of common Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Tensorflow 2.0. Uses the OpenAI Gym environment for algorithm testing.

## Algorithms Implemented

* Vanilla Policy Gradient: Similar to the REINFORCE algorithm, with on-policy Monte Carlo sampling. Uses Adam for optimization.
