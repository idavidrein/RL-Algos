# Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Implementations of common Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Tensorflow 2.0. Uses the OpenAI Gym environment for algorithm testing.

## Algorithms Implemented

* Vanilla Policy Gradient: Similar to the REINFORCE algorithm, with on-policy Monte Carlo sampling. Uses Adam for optimization. 

* A2C: Modification of VPG in which a lower variance (but biased) estimate of reward is used. (Generalized Advantage Estimation currently in progress).
